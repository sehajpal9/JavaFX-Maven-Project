JavaFX Maven Template

Project description:

This is a JavaFx Maven template. I was given starter code from my professor in my CS 342: Software Design course with additional code written by me in the Main.java file. This template is meant to be run from your terminal using Maven. 

Maven:

If you do not already have Maven installed on your machine, you will need to install it in order to run this code. You can do this by following the steps on https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi. 

From there you will open your project in your terminal and launch the application with the following command: mvn clean javafx:run
If you encounter any erroes refer to https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#maven to check that you have the correct dependencies and plugins.
